ObsidianRP
==========

DarkRP for minecraft


This is a very basic version of the plugin, it's not close to done. I published this alpha 
version because I need to find all the bugs before I continue developing.

If  you find any issues then please make support ticket here: https://github.com/Assult/ObsidianRP/issues/new .

The project's BukkitDev page is here: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/obsidianrp/ .

Thank's for reading, and have fun roleplaying!
